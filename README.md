##### ‚ÄúAsk yourself: If what you're working on succeeds beyond your wildest dreams, would you have significantly helped other people? If not, then keep searching for something else to work on. Otherwise you're not living up to your full potential.‚Äù ‚Äï Prof. Andrew Ng

I strongly believe that one should not limit oneself. We should remember that we can achieve everything we believe. In the Nationwide lockdown, my urge for constant learning leads me to the field of Machine Learning. I developed my interest and skills by learning various ML algorithms and understanding the Mathematics behind it. Further, upgraded my knowledge in Neural Networks by completing Coursera‚Äôs Deep Learning Specialization. Now I have completed IBM AI engineering Professional Certification too.

Spending several months into learning Machine Learning & Deep Learning, and practising firmly on ML/DL problems, Now I am looking forward to the job opportunity in this field so I can enhance my experience by utilising my knowledge of this field.
