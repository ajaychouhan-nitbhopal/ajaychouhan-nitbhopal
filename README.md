##### “Ask yourself: If what you're working on succeeds beyond your wildest dreams, would you have significantly helped other people? If not, then keep searching for something else to work on. Otherwise you're not living up to your full potential.” ― Prof. Andrew Ng

#### My life gist :
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deep Learning Algorithms to increase my skills in this field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Computer Vision with OpenCV.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any good DL project related to Computer Vision.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building my career in the field of Machine Learning.
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Industrial Design.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Ajay's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-chouhan-22594a170/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: All of my social media usernames is @VATANUKOOLAK which is Hindi name for Air-Conditiner (A.C., which are also my initials)

I strongly believe that one should not limit oneself. We should remember that we can achieve everything we believe. In the Nationwide lockdown, my urge for constant learning leads me to the field of Machine Learning. I developed my interest and skills by learning various ML algorithms and understanding the Mathematics behind it. Further, upgraded my knowledge in Neural Networks by completing Coursera’s Deep Learning Specialization.

Spending several months into learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning, practising firmly on ML/DL problems, Now I am looking forward to the job opportunity in this field so I can enhance my experience by utilising my knowledge of this field.
